# CS 170 Project Spring 2021

By Neda Shahiar and Mudit Lamba

Requirements:
Python 3.6+
networkx

For networkx installation instructions, follow: https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html

If using pip to download, run `python3 -m pip install networkx`
We did not use any additional libraries outside of what was used in the starter code.

Files:
- `parse.py`: functions to read/write inputs and outputs
- `solver.py`: where you should be writing your code to solve inputs
- `utils.py`: contains functions to compute cost and validate NetworkX graphs

In order to generate outputs for all inputs, simply run `python3 solver.py`.
